"Act as a university guidance counselor and industry analyst specializing in the Communications and Marketing fields within the Vietnamese context, with an understanding of international academic pathways.

I am a high school student in Vietnam (Context: IELTS 7.5, SAT 1500) exploring university options. My primary goal is a major that effectively bridges **Communications and Marketing**. I have a genuine interest and some prior experience in communications through high school activities. My intended career path lies within the broader Marketing field in Vietnam, leveraging strong communication skills.

However, I am also considering the **possibility of pursuing a Master's degree abroad, specifically in International Communication, particularly if I choose the DAV program.**

I need a detailed, objective comparison between two specific programs in Vietnam:

1.  **Marketing Major at National Economics University (NEU)**
2.  **International Communication Major at the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam (DAV)**

**Please compare these programs thoroughly based on the following criteria:**

*   **Curriculum Focus:** Analyze the depth and breadth of subjects related to both Communications and Marketing. How well does each curriculum integrate these fields and align with modern industry practices (including digital aspects)?
*   **Faculty Expertise:** Information on faculty strengths/specializations in relevant Communications and/or Marketing areas.
*   **Practical Experience & Industry Links (Vietnam Focus):** Quality and availability of internships, projects, case studies, and connections to the Communications/Marketing industry *within Vietnam*.
*   **Alumni Network & Career Outcomes (Vietnam Focus):** Known career paths and success of alumni, particularly those in roles combining Communications and Marketing *within Vietnam*.
*   **Learning Environment & Culture:** Compare NEU's business-centric environment with DAV's internationally-oriented environment. Analyze the potential implications (positive/negative) of DAV's international/diplomatic focus for a student aiming primarily for a Communications/Marketing career *in Vietnam*.
*   **English Language Integration:** Briefly describe how English is used within the curriculum and co-curricular activities.
*   **Preparation for International Postgraduate Study (Specifically relevant for DAV):** Evaluate the DAV International Communication program's suitability as a foundation for pursuing a Master's degree abroad (e.g., in International Communication). Consider factors like academic rigor, international recognition/reputation, theoretical grounding for graduate-level work, and potential faculty support/connections for overseas applications. How does this compare to NEU's potential (if any) in this regard?

**Additionally, incorporate an analysis of Future-Readiness concerning Trends and Pathways:**

*   **Future Trends Analysis (Vietnam & Global Influence):** Outline key future trends impacting Marketing and Communications (AI, data, digital channels, content, authentic comms).
*   **Program Preparedness & Future Pathways:** Evaluate how well each program equips students for:
    *   **Immediate careers** in the evolving Communications/Marketing landscape **in Vietnam**.
    *   **(For DAV primarily)** Potential **future international graduate studies** in fields like International Communication.
    *   Which program appears more adaptable or forward-looking considering these potential paths?

**Output Requirements:**

*   Provide a detailed, balanced, and objective comparison, outlining strengths and weaknesses of each program relative to my stated interest in **combining Communications and Marketing for a career in Vietnam**, *while also considering the potential pathway of further international study if choosing DAV*.
*   Use a clear and organized structure (e.g., bullet points, possibly a summary table).
*   The primary career context remains **Vietnam**.
*   **The goal is to provide comprehensive information to aid my own decision-making process**, weighing both immediate career goals in Vietnam and the potential for future international study.
*   Please answer in English."
